## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have discovered a security vulnerability in Scribe, we
appreciate your help in disclosing it to us responsibly.

**Please do not open GitHub issues or pull requests for anything you suspect may
be a security vulnerability.** Instead, email your findings to our dedicated
security team at [security@wcdb.life](mailto:security@wcdb.life). This will help
us to deal with the issue privately and fix the problem before the details
become public knowledge.

**In your report, please include:**

- A brief description of the potential vulnerability.
- Reproduction steps, or a test case, if possible. This will help us to
  replicate the issue and triage more effectively.
- Your contact information, so we can get in touch if we require more
  information.

We will acknowledge your email within 48 hours, and will send a more detailed
response within 48 hours indicating the next steps in handling your report.
After the initial reply to your report, our team will endeavor to keep you
informed of the progress being made towards a fix and announcement.

Please act in good faith towards our users' privacy and data during your
disclosure. We won't take legal action against you if you act accordingly: White
hat researchers are always appreciated and we won't sue you if you make a good
faith effort to follow the guidelines.

## Public Disclosure Policy

We believe that public disclosure of vulnerabilities makes the Internet a safer
place. Therefore, we have the following policy in place:

Once we have a fix implemented and tested, we will prepare a security advisory
in GitHub along with patches for all versions of our software that are still
under maintenance. We will coordinate with you to disclose the issue publicly at
an agreed-upon time, typically 7 to 14 days after we have become aware of it.

We thank you for your contributions to the security of Scribe, and look forward
to working with you.

**Please note:** This policy is subject to change at any time without notice.
