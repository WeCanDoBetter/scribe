This example demonstrates how to create a graph node in Scribe that utilizes the OpenAI API for natural language processing tasks. It showcases the usage of the Scribe API to create a node with custom operations for initialization and execution. The example illustrates how to fetch models from the OpenAI API, register them with the Scribe API, and make API calls based on the specified endpoint (Completion, Chat, or Embeddings). It also demonstrates how to store the API response in the Scribe context for further processing or retrieval by downstream nodes. This example is a valuable resource for users looking to integrate the power of the OpenAI API into their Scribe workflows.
