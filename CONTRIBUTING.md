## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

Bugs are tracked as GitHub issues. If you find a bug, please create an issue in
the repository, following the bug report template.

### Suggesting Enhancements

We welcome any ideas for new features or improvements. If you have an idea,
please create a new issue using the feature request template.

### Code Contributions

Here's a quick guide:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Submit a pull request!

### Pull Requests

The process described here has several goals:

- Maintain Scribe's quality
- Fix problems that are important to users
- Engage the community in working toward the best possible Scribe
- Enable a sustainable system for Scribe's maintainers to review contributions

Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the
maintainers:

1. Follow all instructions in the template
2. After you submit your pull request, verify that all status checks are passing

If a status check is failing, and you believe that the failure is unrelated to
your change, please leave a comment on the pull request explaining why you
believe the failure is unrelated.

## Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

Before your contribution can be accepted, you will need to sign a Contributor
License Agreement (CLA). This is necessary to protect you and us from any future
legal disputes over your contribution. After you open a pull request, a bot will
automatically check to see if you have signed the CLA. If needed, it will

  issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
- [Help Wanted](https://github.com/Scribe/labels/help%20wanted) - issues which
  are a bit more involved than `Good First Issue` issues.
