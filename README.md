Scribe is an innovative context-aware workflow orchestrator designed to manage
and execute complex computational workflows. With the ability to share and
manipulate state data across different tasks, Scribe is the perfect tool to
design workflows for AI development, data processing, and much more.

> **IMPORTANT**: Please be aware that the Scribe project is currently in its
> **alpha phase**. This means that the project is still in its early stages of
> development, and **is not ready for use in a production environment**. For
> more information, see our [alpha release disclaimer](ALPHA.md).
