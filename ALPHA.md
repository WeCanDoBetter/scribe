# Alpha Phase Warning

**IMPORTANT:** Please be aware that the Scribe project is currently in its
**alpha phase**. This means that the project is still in its early stages of
development, and **is not ready for use in a production environment**.

During this alpha phase, **APIs and interfaces may change without notice**. As
we continue to iterate and improve upon the project, these changes could
potentially break existing functionality or require modifications to your code.

We understand the impact that such changes can have and appreciate your
understanding as we work to develop and refine the Scribe project.

## Semantic Versioning

Beginning with version 1.0.0, the Scribe project will start adhering to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). This means that version numbers will
be assigned in a way that reflects the type of changes made to the project,
making it easier for users to understand the impact of upgrading to a new
version.

Thank you for your interest in Scribe and for your understanding during this
phase of its development. We look forward to bringing you a stable,
production-ready version soon!
