In this guide, we aim to provide a comprehensive introduction to Scribe. We'll
delve into the foundational elements like tasks - the basic building blocks of
Scribe workflows. We'll then explore pipelines and graphs, which bring together
tasks in a structured sequence or a flexible directed acyclic graph (DAG)
respectively.

Beyond explaining these concepts, this guide also walks you through practical
examples to demonstrate how these components can be employed in your projects.
We'll cover different use cases, from simple to complex, helping you gain a
holistic understanding of Scribe's capabilities.
